# Solutions and "take-home" messages

In this section you will find the solutions and/or main take home messages of the practical exercises used in this course.

## Solutions: The legend of Ambalapuzha

You can find the completed Excel file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ybe5qhmfltuhoyv/RiceOnAChessboard_completed.xlsx?dl=1).

Take home messages:

* Exponential/geometric growth is extremely powerful and can very quickly lead to very large numbers.


## Solutions: Geometric growth

You can find the completed Excel file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sfxu1lbrxyqt462/GeometricGrowth%20-%20complete.xlsx?dl=1). 

Take home messages:

* The rate of exponential/geometric growth depends on the population growth rate.
* Lambda ($\lambda$) values $<1$ lead to a exponential *decrease*, while values $>1$ lead to exponential growth. A $\lambda$ of 1 indicates no change.
* Growth traj"ectories can be plotted on the "natural scale* or on a *log scale*. Exponential growth (or decline) plotted on a log scale is a straight line. This could be useful to infer biological processes (or the lack of them). For example, exponential growth in population size indicates that there are no forces currently limiting the population (e.g. predators/competition/management actions).

## Solutions: Stochastic population growth

You can find the completed Excel file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/baao06vi0c0quns/StochasticPopulationGrowth-complete.xlsx?dl=1).

Take home messages:

* Population growth rates are unlikely to be constant through time.
* Environmental stochasticity will cause changes through time in vital rates (birth/death) which will influence $\lambda$ (and $r$).
* We can model environmental stochasticity using a distribution of population growth rates instead of a single deterministic value.
* We then can randomly draw growth rate values from this distribution for each time-step in a population projection.
* The "spread" or uncertainty in the population size at a future time point depends on (i) the spread (variance) of the distribution and (ii) the amount of time elapsed. 
* We can repeatedly simulate a population projection (e.g. in R, or more laboriously in Excel) to get a feel for the likely fate of a population. E.g. "what percent of the projections show extinction within 50 years?".
* We can use this relatively simple and "unrealistic" model to nevertheless get an intuition about general trends in population dynamics and extinction risk.
* Extinction probability increases as (i) initial population size decreases; (ii) variance increases; (iii) growth rates decrease; (iv) the time frame increases.

## Solutions: Basic logistic population growth

You were asked to use the Excel sheet to answer some questions about logistic growth by examining the graphs.

**First – take a look at Graph 1**. 

*	*What is the maximum population size?* 
*	*How does this compare to carrying capacity (K)?*
*	*What do you predict to happen if you increase K to 300?*
*	*Try doing that. Were you correct?*

You should notice that when the population growth rate ($r_d$) is around 1 or lower, the maximum population size is the same as the carrying capacity ($K$). As you change $K$, this maximum population size will change accordingly. 

If $r_d$ is markedly greater than 1, then the population size can exceed the carrying capacity. This is because the population grows so fast that it “*overshoots*” carrying capacity and then fluctuates around K.

*	*At what time do you reach the maximum population size?* 
*	*If you halved growth rate (r_d) to 0.4, what do you think will happen to this time? *
*	*Try doing that. Were you correct?*

You should notice that the time taken to reach the maximum population size is related to the growth rate ($r_d$). As you increase $r_d$, the time taken to hit the maximum population size decreases. If you halve the growth rate, the time taken to reach maximum population size is doubled.

*	*What do you think will happen if you increase growth rate to 1.8?* 
*	*Try that… were you correct?*
*	*What do you notice about the population size through time?* 
*	*How does the maximum population size compare with the carrying capacity?* 
* *How would you describe the ‘dynamics’ of this population?*

You should notice that the population overshoots carrying capacity ($K$), then oscillates around $K$ with damped oscilllations that gradually move towards $K$. Therefore if a population has even a moderate population growth rate, and if it has density-dependence, then it can fluctuate in numbers without any extrinsic factor (like weather) acting.

*	*What happens if you increase the growth rate even more, to 2 or 2.1?* 
*	*And even more to 2.8, 2.9 or 3?* 
*	*How would you describe these dynamics?* 
*	*Is there a limit to how high `r_d` can be? (hint: populations go extinct if N < 0).*

You should notice that as you increase $r_d$ the nature of the oscillations changes. In fact, this is predictable:  If $r_d < 1.0$, then population will approach $K$ smoothly.

If $1.0 < r_d < 2.0$, then oscillations of decreasing amplitude around K.

If $2.0< r_d < 2.57$, then stable, cyclic oscillations around K . They can be 1 or 2+ point stable limit cycles.

If $r_d > 2.57$, then population will fluctuate chaotically.

If $r_d$ is too high, the population will fluctuate and crash to extinction.

*Compare the population trajectory in Graph 1 for populations with $r_d$= 2.8 and 2.81. Then compare the trajectories where you fix $r_d$ at 2.8 but vary initial population size by a small amount (e.g. 1). Imagine you were a population manager – would these populations be easy or hard to predict? What kinds of species have high population growth rates like these?*

When $r_d$ is high ($>2.57$) the population dynamics become extremely hard (impossible) to predict because they are chaotic. This means that even a very small change in $r_d$ (which could simply be measurement error) will mean that predicted population size next year is suddenly very different. This would cause big problems to a population manager.

Many pest species and diseases have very high population growth rates. For example, locusts, or measles. This is one reason why it is hard to predict when the next pest/disease outbreak will happen

**Now let’s turn to Graphs 2 and 3**

*In graph 2, notice that the per capita growth rate always declines linearly with population size ($N$). Where does it cross the x-axis line? Modify the carrying capacity ($K$) – what do you notice?*

The line describing per capita growth rate crosses the x-axis (population size) at $K$. i.e. if $K = 100$, the line crosses at 100. If you change $K$, the intercept on the axis also changes accordingly. The line intercepts the axis at this point no matter what the population growth rate is.

*Graph 3 is shaped like a parabola, starting with small values, increasing to a maximum, then declining to small values again. The position of the maximum is dependent on the values of K and r_d. When r_d is small (around 1), the peak is at x=K and y=K. Explore (1) how the peak moves around if you fix one of K or r_d and alter the other parameter and (2) how the slope of the line changes at Nt=K. (Hint: the slope of the line changes from positive to negative as r_d increases)*

As mentioned above, the peak of the parabola will be at $K$ on both axes when $r_d$ is small.  You should see that this makes sense because if the population is at carrying capacity in Year 1 (`Nt`, on the x-axis) then next year (Year 2; `Nt+1` on the y-axis) the population size will be the same because with logistic growth the population growth rate is always 0 when the population is at carrying capacity. Therefore, if you change $K$, the peak will move around accordingly, but always will be at $x=K$ and $y=K$.

If you increase $r_d$ above 1, the shape of the relationship between $N_t$ and $N_{t+1}$ remains parabolic, but the location of the peak changes relative to $K$.

*How would the same plots look for regular exponential growth?*

The equivalent plot (for Graph 2) for exponential growth would be a horizontal line - because population growth rate does NOT depend on population size.
