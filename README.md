### Things to do each year:

- Look for references to the year (e.g. 2023) and change them to the current year.
- Check schedule times are OK and confirm that the times are correct by cross-referencing the outputs on the website with the official calendar.
- Edit the Instructors part of `index.Rmd` to add/remove instructors as appropriate.
- Edit the Excel schedule `BB512_Schedule.xlsx` to put the instructors in the correct place.
- Style check: Run `styler::style_dir(filetype = "Rmd")`
- Spell check: use `scripts/Check Spelling.R`
- Rebuild GitHub site. (`Build Book` button in RStudio)
