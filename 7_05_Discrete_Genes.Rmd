# Continuous traits from discrete genes

## Background

This activity uses a fast classroom simulation to show how many small genetic effects can generate a continuous, approximately normal trait distribution. It connects to the heritability workflow in `3_04_Heritability.Rmd`.

Learning outcomes: 

- Explain how additive genetic effects create continuous trait variation.
- Compare a classroom simulation with a simple R simulation.

## Worked example

If a trait has a baseline of 35 and is influenced by 25 genes, where each gene contributes 1 unit when "on", then the expected trait value is 35 + 12.5 = 47.5. Individual values vary around this because each gene is ON or OFF.

## Your task

Use the intuition exercise in `supplemental/Quantitative_Genetics/Continuous_Traits_From_Discrete_Genes.docx` and the spreadsheet in `supplemental/Quantitative_Genetics/Continuous_Traits_From_Discrete_Genes.xlsx`.

1. In class, treat each student as a gene that can be ON (1) or OFF (0). Choose a baseline trait value of 35, and add 1 for each ON gene. Record the trait value for at least 30 individuals.
2. Plot a quick histogram of the observed trait values. Describe the shape.
3. Now simulate the same process in R for 100 individuals and 25 genes. Compare your histogram to the classroom version.
4. Relate the outcome to the concept of additive genetic variance in `3_04_Heritability.Rmd`.

```{r discrete-genes-sim, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(123)
baseline <- 35
n_genes <- 25
n_individuals <- 100

gene_on <- rbinom(n_individuals, size = n_genes, prob = 0.5)
trait_value <- baseline + gene_on

hist(trait_value, breaks = 12, col = "gray80", main = "Trait values", xlab = "Trait")
```

## Takeaways

- Many small additive effects naturally yield a continuous distribution.
- Random genetic variation produces a spread of trait values even with identical environments.
