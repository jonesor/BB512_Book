Jones (Course Coordinator) 2022-08-08 1 Welcome to BB512 Welcome to the 2022 Population and Evolution course. The course, and this website, is divided into five parts: Evolution by Natural Selection Population Growth Models Population Genetics and Evolution Interactions Between Species and Community Structure Animal Behaviour, Altruism and Sexual Selection The recommended textbook is Neal (2018). Other useful textbooks, that are NOT mandatory, but could be useful are Gotelli (2008) and Stearns &amp; Hoekstra (2005). Neal, D. (2018). Introduction to Population Biology (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781139107976 Gotelli, NJ (2008) A Primer of Ecology. Fourth Edition, Sinauer Associates. ISBN: 978-0878933181 Stearns, SC &amp; Hoekstra, RF (2005) Evolution: An Introduction. 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press. ISBN: 978-0199255634 1.1 This website and other course materials This website is designed to hold most of the materials you need for the practical exercises you will do during the course. You will also find the Schedule here. We may not do ALL of these exercises, but you are welcome to do ones we miss in your own time. You will find other materials via itsLearning. Apart from the book, there will be some recommended scientific papers to read – these will be accessible via links on itsLearning. In many of the classes there will be exercises conducted on your personal laptops. Please bring them to class (and remember a power supply!). 1.2 Expectations There are lectures and exercise sessions on the course. The exercise sessions are designed to help you understand the subject better and I expect students to attend and actively participate in both. There will also be some multiple choice quizes (e-tests) during the semester. These are intended to help you figure out whether you know the material, and whether there are areas you need to revisit. They do not contribute to your final grade, but I hope you will attempt them. They will definitely increase your understanding of the material. Note that the final assessment will be a similar format! I also expect students to make every effort to keep up with the core reading (mainly the textbook chapters), and to ask questions where they don’t understand. 1.3 Your feedback I would really like your feedback on how the course is progressing so I can address any issues that come up as soon as possible. To help with this I have created a simple Google Form: http://goo.gl/gy2Q6B. You can use this to send me (Owen) comments (anonymously if you wish) at any time in the course. I promise to do my best to resolve any problems. 1.4 Assessment The assessment for the course will be an electronic exam held next January with multiple choice and short answer questions. It is worth noting that exam format will be similar to the quizzes mentioned above. The exact date is not yet set. 1.5 Instructors The instructors of the course are: Owen Jones, Associate Professor, jones@biology.sdu.dk Thomas Bjørneboe Berg, Associate Prof./Senior Scientist at Naturama, thomas@naturama.dk Finally, if you have any problems accessing materials, or have any questions regarding the course feel free to send me an email, or make a comment in the form I mentioned above. You can also make an appointment to see me via Zoom or in my office if necessary*.
