It’s particularly useful for understanding how specific factors like survival rates, fecundity, or other stage-to-stage transitions influence the growth or decline of a population under different conditions. The method involves comparing matrix models of the populations in question and decomposing the differences in growth rates different models into contributions from individual matrix elements. This approach provides insights into which life cycle stages or transitions are most important for population growth and can inform conservation or management strategies. 10.2 Set up First we need to ensure that we have the R packages we need loaded. If you get an error doing this, remember to install them first (install.packages(\"PACKAGE_NAME\")) library(popbio) library(popdemo) ## Welcome to popdemo! This is version 1.3-0 ## Use ?popdemo for an intro, or browseVignettes(&#39;popdemo&#39;) for vignettes ## Citation for popdemo is here: doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00222.x ## Development and legacy versions are here: github.com/iainmstott/popdemo library(Rcompadre) 10.3 A worked example Imagine we have a population of a species A_ref &lt;- matrix(c(0.1,2.3, 0.5,0.6), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE) A_treat &lt;- matrix(c(0.1,1.3, 0.2,0.7), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE) 10.3.1 Comparing transition rates The two matrices, A_ref and A_treat, are different. We can check what overall difference there is between the matrix in a couple of ways. Firstly, we can examine the differences in the individual transition rates between the matrices by subtracting one from the other. A_ref - A_treat ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0.0 1.0 ## [2,] 0.3 -0.1 10.3.2 Comparing population growth rates Next, we can ask what impact these differences have on the population growth rate (lambda). Note that putting the command in parentheses tells R to both create the new object (e.g. lambdaA1) and print the result to the screen. (lambda_A_ref &lt;- eigs(A_ref, what = &quot;lambda&quot;)) ## [1] 1.451136 (lambda_A_treat &lt;-eigs(A_treat, what = &quot;lambda&quot;)) ## [1] 0.991608 We could express this as a difference, or as a proportional difference. The difference in growth rates between the matrices is 0.46. (lambdaDiff &lt;- lambda_A_ref - lambda_A_treat) ## [1] 0.4595278 This is a 32% reduction, compared to the reference matrix. (lambdaDiff/lambda_A_ref) * 100 ## [1] 31.66677 So far, so good. We can see that treatment reduces the population growth rate, but we don’t know exactly how. There are 3 changes in the matrix. Which of these changes is most instrumental in driving change in the population growth rate? 10.3.3 Contributions from individual matrix elements popbio::LTRE(A_treat,A_ref) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0.0000000 -0.20832964 ## [2,] -0.3214229 0.06636876 This summary quantifies the relative importance (and direction) of the effect of the differences between the two matrices on the difference in population growth rate. One of the changes actually has a positive impact on growth rate, but this is opposed by the other two changes. The most important of these two is the lower left element, which represents the ontogenetic development from juvenile to adult stage.
