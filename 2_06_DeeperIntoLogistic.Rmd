# Deeper into Logistic Growth

## Background

The logistic and exponential growth models are closely related and serve as fundamental tools in understanding population dynamics.

- The **exponential (geometric)** growth model assumes that populations grow without any environmental constraints, leading to unlimited growth. 
- The **logistic** growth model, on the other hand, incorporates environmental limits, specifically the **carrying capacity** ($K$), which represents the maximum number of individuals the environment can support. 

### Linking Logistic and Exponential Growth Models

The logistic growth model is represented by the following equation (Eqn. 5.2 in Neal):

$\frac{\delta N}{\delta t}=r_m N\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)$

In this model, as the population size $N$ approaches the carrying capacity $K$, the term $\left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right)$ decreases, slowing the population growth rate until it reaches zero when $N = K$.

However, if we remove the constraint of a carrying capacity (i.e., set $K = \infty$), the model simplifies to the exponential growth equation:

$\frac{\delta N}{\delta t}=r_m N\left(1-\frac{N}{\infty}\right)$

which simplifies to 

$\frac{\delta N}{\delta t}=r_m N\left(1-0\right)$

which simplifies to 

$\frac{\delta N}{\delta t}= r_m N$

This is the familiar **geometric (exponential) growth equation** (Eqn. 4.6 in Neal), which assumes unlimited resources and continuous population growth.

**Take-home Message: The logistic and exponential growth models are closely related. By setting $K = \infty$, we transition from the logistic model to the exponential model.**

## Your Task

Download the Excel file [`Deeper Into Logistic Growth.xlsx`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4xq399z7skl1akv/Deeper%20into%20Logistic%20Growth.xlsx?dl=1).

Look at the `BasicLogistic` worksheet and work through the following tasks:


**Task 1: Population Dynamics (Figure 1)**

1. Experiment with different values of $r_m$ (e.g., 0.8, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, 2.7) and observe how the population dynamics change over time in **Figure 1**.
   
2. Use the following terms to describe the dynamics you see: 

   - **Oscillation**, **damped oscillation**, **stable cycle**, **2-point cycle**, **chaotic**, **unpredictable**, **predictable**.


**Task 2: Per Capita Growth Rate vs. Population Size (Figure 2)**

1. Examine **Figure 2**, which shows the per capita growth rate as a function of population size at time $t$.
   
2. Notice where the line intercepts the x- and y-axes. 

   - What are these intercepts? 
   - How do these intercepts relate to the values of $r_m$ and $K$ that you have set?

3. Try varying the values for $r_m$ and $K$, and note how the graph changes. 

4. On paper, sketch a graph of the per capita growth rate vs. population size for a logistic model with $r_m = 1.5$ and $K = 250$. Then, verify your sketch by entering these values into the Excel model.


**Task 3: Population Growth Rate vs. Population Size (Figure 3)**

1. **Figure 3** shows the overall population growth rate ($dN/dt$) â€” the change in population size per unit time. Adjust the values for $r_m$ and $K$ and observe how **Figure 3** changes.

2. Answer the following questions:

   - At what population sizes is the population growth rate 0 ($dN/dt = 0$)?
   - At what population size is the growth rate maximized?


**Task 4: Comparison with Exponential Growth**

1. Now, consider the differences between **logistic growth** and **exponential growth**. How would Figures 1, 2, and 3 change when considering exponential growth?

Sketch equivalent graphs for the exponential (geometric) growth model, including:

   - **Fig 1**: Population size ($N$) over time ($t$).
   - **Fig 2**: Per capita growth rate ($\frac{1}{N} \frac{dN}{dt}$) vs. population size ($N$).
   - **Fig 3**: Population growth rate ($\frac{dN}{dt}$) vs. population size ($N$) 

2. Look at the **`Exponential` worksheet** to see how close you were.

**Task 5: Adding a Time Lag**

1. In the **`TimeLag` worksheet**, explore how adding a time lag to the logistic model affects population dynamics. This is the equation we are are using: $\frac{d N}{d t}=r N\left(1-\frac{N_{t-\tau}}{K}\right)$


2. Adjust the formula in the Excel sheet to incorporate a time lag in the population size ($N_{t-\tau}$). Start with a small $r_m$ value that results in smooth convergence to $K$ in the ordinary logistic model. 

3. Add a 1-year time lag and observe how this introduces cycling in the population dynamics. This exercise demonstrates how a simple life history trait (such as a time lag) can introduce complex dynamics, even when population growth rates are low.


## Questions

* How does increasing or decreasing $r_m$ affect the shape and behaviour of the population time series in Figure 1? How does it change the per capita growth rate curve in Figure 2 and the population growth rate in Figure 3?

<!-- In Figure 1, as $r_m$ increases, the population grows more rapidly. For small values of $r_m$ (e.g., 0.8), the population slowly approaches the carrying capacity $K$. For higher values of $r_m$ (e.g., 1.8, 2.7), the population may overshoot $K$ and oscillate before stabilising, or it may exhibit chaotic behaviour if $r_m$ is large enough (e.g., above 2.5).
In Figure 2, increasing $r_m$ makes the slope of the line steeper. Higher $r_m$ values result in a higher per capita growth rate when the population size is small. However, the line still intercepts the x-axis at $K$, meaning that the carrying capacity doesn't change, but the rate at which the population reaches $K$ does.
In Figure 3, as $r_m$ increases, the overall population growth rate increases, with the peak growth rate shifting to a higher value. However, as the population approaches $K$, the growth rate still decreases to zero. -->

* What happens to the population dynamics when a time lag is introduced?

<!--     Introducing a time lag in the feedback system (i.e., where the population size at a given time depends on the population size at a previous time step) typically leads to more complex and sometimes oscillatory dynamics:
     A time lag may cause the population to overshoot the carrying capacity and then oscillate around $K$. This happens because the time lag delays the response of the population to changes in resource availability, leading to a cycle of growth and decline.
