# (PART) Interactions Between Species and Community Structure {-}

This part explores how species interactions shape population and community dynamics, using competition and predator-prey models.

By the end of Part 4, you should be able to:

- Interpret competition and predator-prey dynamics from model outputs.
- Compare continuous- and discrete-time interaction models.
- Reason about stability and equilibrium in multi-species systems.
