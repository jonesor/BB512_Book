# Basic logistic population growth

## Background

Population sizes usually have upper limits - they can only get so large before leveling off due to environmental constraints. The logistic growth model is a powerful tool in population ecology that takes this limitation into account, providing a more realistic depiction of population dynamics. Unlike the simplistic geometric growth model, which assumes unlimited resources and unrestricted growth, the logistic model recognizes that natural populations face a finite carrying capacity (K). This carrying capacity represents the maximum population size an environment can sustain over the long term, considering factors such as available resources, competition for food and space, predation, and disease. As a population approaches its carrying capacity, its growth rate gradually slows down, eventually reaching a point of equilibrium where birth rates equal death rates, leading to a stable population size. This concept of limited growth and self-regulation enables the logistic growth model to offer deeper insights into the delicate balance between a population's reproductive potential and the constraints imposed by its habitat, making it an invaluable tool for understanding ecological dynamics and conservation efforts.

The logistic growth model can be expressed like this, which is derived from Eqn. 5.2 in Neal: 

$N_{t+1}=N_{t}+r_{m} N_{t}\left(1-\frac{N_{t}}{K}\right)$

This equation models population at time $t+1$ ($N_{t+1}$) as a function of the population at time $t$ ($N_t$), the *intrinsic rate of increase* ($r_m$), and carrying capacity of the environment ($K$). 

The idea is that the growth rate of the population (the difference between $N_{t+1}$ and $N_t$) decreases as the population increases in size. When the population size at $N_t$ is equal to the *carrying capacity* of the environment ($K$), the population growth rate is zero. For example, if the carrying capacity of the population is *200*, and there are already *200* individuals in the population, then the size of the population will remain unchanged through time ($N_{t+1} = N_t = 200$).

The aim of this Excel-based exercise is to explore this model and help you get an intuitive understanding of it by looking at it from different perspectives. Even though it is a fairly simple model, it leads us to some useful biological insights.

## Your task


Download and open the Excel file: [`Basic Logistic Growth.xslx`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oxxyyn4zf4wsvkg/Basic%20Logistic%20Growth.xlsx?dl=1).

You will see that there are three blocks of numbers, and three graphs.
During the exercise you only need to edit the pink block.

The pink block gives the important parameters of the logistic model:

*	`Initial N` = the starting population size at time 1.
*	`r_m` =  the maximum per capita population growth rate ($r_m$). When $r_m$ is 0, the population does not grow. When $r_m$ is $>$ 0 the population grows, and when it is $<$ 0 it declines. The population cannot fall below 0.
*	`K` = the carrying capacity of the population.

The initial values for these are *10*, *0.8* and *200* respectively.

In this exercises you will be altering these parameters and observing the outcome in the 3 graphs which show:

1.	The population size through time.
2.	The per capita growth rate of the population in relation to population size
3.	The relationship between population size at time t and at time t+1

## Graph 1

First – take a look at **Graph 1**. 

*	What is the maximum population size? 
* How does this compare to carrying capacity (`K`)? 
* What do you predict to happen if you increase `K` to *300*? (try it)

<!--You should notice that when `r_m` is around 1 or lower, the maximum population size is the same as the carrying capacity (`K`). As you change `K`, this maximum population size will change accordingly. 
If `r_m` is markedly greater than 1, then the population size can exceed the carrying capacity. This is because the population grows so fast that it “overshoots” carrying capacity and then fluctuates around `K`.-->

* At what time do you reach the maximum population size? 
* If you halved the growth rate (`r_m`) to *0.4*, what do you think will happen to the dynamics this time? (try it)

<!-- You should notice that the time taken to reach the maximum population size is related to the growth rate (`r_m`). As you increase `r_m`, the time taken to hit the maximum population size decreases. If you halve the `r_m`, the time taken to reach maximum population size is doubled.
-->

* What do you think will happen if you `r_m` to *1.8*? (try it)
* What do you notice about the population size through time? 
* How does the maximum population size compare with the carrying capacity? How would you describe the ‘*dynamics*’ of this population?

<!--You should notice that the population overshoots carrying capacity (`K`), then oscillates around `K` with damped oscilllations that gradually move towards `K`. Therefore if a population has even a moderate population growth rate, and if it has density-dependence, then it can fluctuate in numbers without any extrinsic factor (like weather) acting. 
-->

* What happens if you increase the `r_m` even more, to *2* or *2.1*? 
* And even more to *2.8*, *2.9* or *3*? 
* How would you describe these dynamics? 
* Is there a limit to how high `r_m` can be? (hint: populations go extinct if N $<$ 0).

<!--
You should notice that as you increase `r_m` the nature of the oscillations changes. In fact, this is predictable:  If `r_m` $<$ 1.0, then population will approach `K` smoothly.

If 1.0 $<$ `r_m` $<$ 2.0, then oscillations of decreasing amplitude around `K`.

If 2.0 $<$ `r_m` $<$ 2.57, then stable, cyclic oscillations around `K` . They can be 1 or 2+ point stable limit cycles.

If `r_m` $>$ 2.57, then population will fluctuate chaotically.

If `r_m` is too high, the population will fluctuate and crash to extinction.
-->

Finally, compare the population trajectory in **Graph 1** for populations with `r_m`= *2.8* and *2.81*. Then compare the trajectories where you fix `r_m` at *2.8* but vary initial population size by a small amount (e.g. *1*). Imagine you were a population manager – would these populations be easy or hard to predict? What kinds of species have high population growth rates like these?

<!--
When `r_m` is high ($>$ 2.57) the population dynamics become extremely hard (impossible) to predict because they are chaotic. This means that even a very small change in `r_m` (which could simply be measurement error) will mean that predicted population size next year is suddenly very different. This would cause big problems to a population manager.

Many pest species and diseases have very high population growth rates. For example, locusts, or measles. This is one reason why it is hard to predict when the next pest/disease outbreak will happen
-->


## Graphs 2 & 3

Now let’s turn to **Graphs 2** and **3**, which show the relationship between per capita population growth rate ($r$) and $N$, and between $dN/dt$ and $N_t$ respectively.

In **Graph 2**, notice that the per capita growth rate ($r$) always declines linearly with population size (`N`). Where does it cross the x-axis line? Modify the carrying capacity (`K`) – what do you notice about the intercepts on the y and x axes?

<!--
The line describing per capita growth rate crosses the x-axis (population size) at $K$. i.e. if $K$ = 100, the line crosses at 100. If you change $K$, the intercept on the axis also changes accordingly. The line intercepts the axis at this point no matter what the population growth rate is.
-->

**Graph 3** is shaped like a parabola, starting with small values, increasing to a maximum, then declining to small values again. The peak of the parabola is at $K/2$ and the line crosses the y-axis at $0$ and $K$. Confirm to yourself, by changing the values for $r_m$ and $K$ that this is always the case.



```{block, type="do-something"}
These three graphs are simply different ways to visualize the same model. It is important that you can make the connections between these graphs.

How would the same plots look for regular exponential growth?

## Additional questions

- In the logistic growth model, what happens to the population growth rate as the population size approaches the carrying capacity (K)? How does this lead to population stability?
- In the logistic growth model, what factors can cause a population to overshoot its carrying capacity temporarily? How does the population respond to such overshooting?
- How can a ballpark knowledge of maximum per capita population growth rate be useful to a population manager?
- Consider the relevance of the logistic growth model in ecological conservation. How can an understanding of logistic growth help in managing and conserving endangered species?
