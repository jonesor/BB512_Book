# Estimating Population Growth Rate

## Background

In population biology, one important measure of population dynamics is the population growth rate (\(\lambda\)), also known as the finite rate of increase. 

The finite rate of increase (\(\lambda\)) is defined as the ratio of population size at time t + 1 to that at time t (\(N_{t+1}/N_t\)), and it is related to the intrinsic rate of increase r by the expression (\(r = \ln \lambda\)).

This rate tells us how fast a population is growing or shrinking over time. When \(\lambda > 1\), the population grows exponentially; when \(\lambda = 1\), it stays constant, and when \(\lambda < 1\), the population declines.

In this exercise, you will estimate the population growth rate (\(\lambda\)) from real population data. The method involves plotting the population size over time, applying a log transformation to linearise the data, and fitting a linear regression model to estimate \(\lambda\). This method is widely used in ecology to analyse growth trends and make predictions.

```{r generateDataPopGrowth, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#Simulate data for this exercise
# Set parameters for the simulation
set.seed(9)  # For reproducibility

lambda <- 1.09  # Base growth rate (lambda)
N0 <- 16       # Initial population size
years <- 25     # Number of years to simulate
noise_level <- 0.1  # Noise level (as a fraction of lambda)
measurement_error_level <- 0.15  # Noise level for measurement error (as a fraction of population size)

# Initialize a vector to store true population sizes
population <- numeric(years)
population[1] <- N0

# Simulate population growth with noise added to the growth rate (lambda)
for (t in 2:years) {
  # Add random noise to lambda
  noisy_lambda <- rnorm(1, mean = lambda, sd = noise_level * lambda)
  
  # Ensure that noisy lambda is positive to avoid negative growth
  noisy_lambda <- max(noisy_lambda, 0)
  
  # Calculate new population size with the noisy growth rate and ensure it's an integer
  new_population <- population[t-1] * noisy_lambda
  
  # Round to the nearest integer and ensure it's non-negative
  population[t] <- max(round(new_population), 0)
}

# Create a vector for measured population sizes with measurement error
measured_population <- population  # Copy true population data
for (t in 1:years) {
  # Add random measurement error proportional to the population size
  measurement_noise <- rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = measurement_error_level * population[t])
  
  # Ensure the measured population size is an integer and non-negative
  measured_population[t] <- max(round(population[t] + measurement_noise), 0)
}

# Create a data frame for easier plotting or further analysis
data <- data.frame(Year = seq(1, years), True_Population = population, Measured_Population = measured_population)

# # Plot the true vs. measured population growth over time
# plot(data$Year, data$True_Population, type = "o", col = "blue", pch = 16,
#      xlab = "Year", ylab = "Population Size",
#      main = "True vs. Measured Population with Measurement Error", ylim = c(0, max(data$True_Population, data$Measured_Population)))
# lines(data$Year, data$Measured_Population, type = "o", col = "red", pch = 1)
# legend("topleft", legend = c("True Population", "Measured Population"), col = c("blue", "red"), pch = c(16, 1))

# Write the data to a CSV file
write.csv(data, file = "data/population_growth_with_measurement_error.csv", row.names = FALSE)

## Worked example

If the regression of $ln(N_t)$ on time gives a slope of 0.08, then:

$\lambda = e^{0.08} = 1.083$

This indicates a population growing by about 8.3% per time step.

## Your task

**Step 1: Download and Open the Data**

- Download the provided Excel file: [`EstimatingGrowth.xlsx`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/k9z32wndllofihsyhj728/EstimatingGrowth.xlsx?rlkey=7gukyzvdm4pv1wsbnljfymvx1&dl=1).
- Open the file in Excel to view the population data for a species recorded annually over a 25-year period.

**Step 2: Plot the Population Size Over Time**

- In Excel, create an x-y scatter plot of the **population size** (\(N_t\)) on the y-axis and **time** (Year) on the x-axis.

**Step 3: Log-Transform the Population Size**

- Add a new column in Excel for the natural logarithm of the population size using the formula `=LN(cell)`. This transformation helps linearise the exponential growth data.
- Create a new scatter plot with **log-transformed population size** (\(\log_e(N_t)\)) on the y-axis and **time** (Year) on the x-axis.

**Step 4: Fit a Linear Regression Model**

- In the log-transformed scatter plot, add a trendline by right-clicking on the data points and selecting "Add Trendline."
- Choose "Linear" and ensure you check the box to "Display Equation on Chart."
- The slope of the trendline represents \(\log(\lambda)\).

**Step 5: Calculate \(\lambda\)**

- Use the slope from the regression equation to calculate \(\lambda\) with the formula: \(\lambda = e^{\text{slope}}\). In Excel, you can do this with the equation `=EXP(cell)`

## Questions

* What does the log-transformed plot of population size over time tell you about the population's growth trend? Does the population appear to grow exponentially?
* What is the estimated population growth rate (\(\lambda\)) based on your linear regression analysis?
* What assumptions does this model make about population growth? Discuss any potential real-world factors that might affect the accuracy of your estimate for \(\lambda\).

## Takeaways

- Estimating $\lambda$ from data relies on a log-transform and a linear trend over time.
- The slope of $ln(N_t)$ vs. time is $ln(\lambda)$, so $\lambda$ is the exponential of the slope.
- Measurement error and changing environments can bias simple growth estimates.
