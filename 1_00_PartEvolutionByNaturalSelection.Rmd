# Part 1: Evolution by Natural Selection {#part-1 .unnumbered}

This part introduces the core logic of natural selection using simple, concrete activities. You will move from a conceptual model of selection to an interactive simulation of adaptation.

By the end of Part 1, you should be able to:

- Explain how selection can generate order from random variation.
- Identify the roles of variation, heritability, and environment in adaptation.
- Describe how selection pressures shape trait distributions over time.
