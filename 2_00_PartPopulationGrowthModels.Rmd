# Part 2: Population Growth Models {#part-2 .unnumbered}

This part builds the core toolkit for describing and predicting population change. You will move from basic growth models to stochasticity, life tables, and structured population models.

By the end of Part 2, you should be able to:

- Distinguish exponential, geometric, and logistic growth models.
- Interpret how parameters like growth rate and carrying capacity shape dynamics.
- Use life tables and matrix models to analyze structured populations.
