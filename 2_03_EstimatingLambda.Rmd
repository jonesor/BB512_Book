# Estimating Population Growth Rate

## Background
In population biology, one important measure of population dynamics is the population growth rate (\(\lambda\)). This rate tells us how fast a population is growing or shrinking over time. When \(\lambda > 1\), the population grows exponentially; when \(\lambda = 1\), it stays constant, and when \(\lambda < 1\), the population declines.

In this exercise, you will estimate the population growth rate (\(\lambda\)) from real population data. The method involves plotting the population size over time, applying a log transformation to linearise the data, and fitting a linear regression model to estimate \(\lambda\). This method is widely used in ecology to analyse growth trends and make predictions.

```{r generateDataPopGrowth,eval = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#Simulate data for this exercise
# Set parameters for the simulation
set.seed(9)  # For reproducibility

lambda <- 1.09  # Base growth rate (lambda)
N0 <- 16       # Initial population size
years <- 25     # Number of years to simulate
noise_level <- 0.1  # Noise level (as a fraction of lambda)
measurement_error_level <- 0.15  # Noise level for measurement error (as a fraction of population size)

# Initialize a vector to store true population sizes
population <- numeric(years)
population[1] <- N0

# Simulate population growth with noise added to the growth rate (lambda)
for (t in 2:years) {
  # Add random noise to lambda
  noisy_lambda <- rnorm(1, mean = lambda, sd = noise_level * lambda)
  
  # Ensure that noisy lambda is positive to avoid negative growth
  noisy_lambda <- max(noisy_lambda, 0)
  
  # Calculate new population size with the noisy growth rate and ensure it's an integer
  new_population <- population[t-1] * noisy_lambda
  
  # Round to the nearest integer and ensure it's non-negative
  population[t] <- max(round(new_population), 0)
}

# Create a vector for measured population sizes with measurement error
measured_population <- population  # Copy true population data
for (t in 1:years) {
  # Add random measurement error proportional to the population size
  measurement_noise <- rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = measurement_error_level * population[t])
  
  # Ensure the measured population size is an integer and non-negative
  measured_population[t] <- max(round(population[t] + measurement_noise), 0)
}

# Create a data frame for easier plotting or further analysis
data <- data.frame(Year = seq(1, years), True_Population = population, Measured_Population = measured_population)

# # Plot the true vs. measured population growth over time
# plot(data$Year, data$True_Population, type = "o", col = "blue", pch = 16,
#      xlab = "Year", ylab = "Population Size",
#      main = "True vs. Measured Population with Measurement Error", ylim = c(0, max(data$True_Population, data$Measured_Population)))
# lines(data$Year, data$Measured_Population, type = "o", col = "red", pch = 1)
# legend("topleft", legend = c("True Population", "Measured Population"), col = c("blue", "red"), pch = c(16, 1))

# Write the data to a CSV file
write.csv(data, file = "data/population_growth_with_measurement_error.csv", row.names = FALSE)

## Your task

### Step 1: Download and Open the Data
- Download the provided Excel file: [`EstimatingGrowth.xlsx`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/k9z32wndllofihsyhj728/EstimatingGrowth.xlsx?rlkey=7gukyzvdm4pv1wsbnljfymvx1&dl=1).
- Open the file in Excel to view the population data for a species recorded annually over a 25-year period.

### Step 2: Plot the Population Size Over Time
- In Excel, create an x-y scatter plot of the **population size** (\(N_t\)) on the y-axis and **time** (Year) on the x-axis.

### Step 3: Log-Transform the Population Size
- Add a new column in Excel for the natural logarithm of the population size using the formula `=LN(cell)`. This transformation helps linearise the exponential growth data.
- Create a new scatter plot with **log-transformed population size** (\(\log_e(N_t)\)) on the y-axis and **time** (Year) on the x-axis.

### Step 4: Fit a Linear Regression Model
- In the log-transformed scatter plot, add a trendline by right-clicking on the data points and selecting "Add Trendline."
- Choose "Linear" and ensure you check the box to "Display Equation on Chart."
- The slope of the trendline represents \(\log(\lambda)\).

### Step 5: Calculate \(\lambda\)
- Use the slope from the regression equation to calculate \(\lambda\) with the formula: \(\lambda = e^{\text{slope}}\). In Excel, you can do this with the equation `=EXP(cell)`

## Questions
1. **Interpret the Plot**: What does the log-transformed plot of population size over time tell you about the population's growth trend? Does the population appear to grow exponentially?
2. **Estimate Growth Rate**: What is the estimated population growth rate (\(\lambda\)) based on your linear regression analysis?
3. **Model Assumptions**: What assumptions does this model make about population growth? Discuss any potential real-world factors that might affect the accuracy of your estimate for \(\lambda\).



### Key Quantities
- **\(N_t\)**: population size at time \(t\).
- **\(\lambda\)**: population growth (multiplication) rate per time step. 
- **\(\log_e(N_t)\)**: natural logarithm of the population size at time \(t\), used to linearise the data for regression analysis.
