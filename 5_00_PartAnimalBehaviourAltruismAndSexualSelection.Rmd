# Part 5: Animal behaviour, altruism and sexual selection {#part-5 .unnumbered}

This part uses game theory and behavioral models to explore how selection shapes strategies like aggression, cooperation, and mating behavior.

By the end of Part 5, you should be able to:

- Explain how payoffs influence behavioral strategies.
- Use game-theoretic reasoning to interpret conflicts and cooperation.
- Connect behavioral models to evolutionary outcomes.
