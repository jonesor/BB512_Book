# From plain English to a matrix model

## Background

This activity is designed for quick in-class practice translating a verbal life-history description into a matrix population model. It connects directly to the workflow in `2_07_matrixModels.Rmd`.

::: {.do-something}
Learning outcomes: 

- Convert a verbal life-history description into a matrix population model.
- Build and interpret a simple projection from initial stage abundances.

## Worked example

### Inputs

Suppose juveniles do not reproduce, adults produce 2 offspring per year, juvenile survival is 0.4, and adult survival is 0.7. A simple stage matrix would be:

### Steps

1. Put fecundity terms in the top row.
2. Put survival/transition terms in the subdiagonal/diagonal entries.
3. Assemble the matrix in row = stage at $t+1$, column = stage at $t$ form.

### Output and interpretation

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 2 \\
0.4 & 0.7
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The key idea is to map each biological statement to a matrix entry: fecundity goes in the top row, survival and stage transitions go on the sub-diagonal or main diagonal.

## Your task

Use the red-tailed hawk life history description in `supplemental/Exercise_Plain_English_To_Matrix_Model_2018.txt`.

1. Draw a 3-stage life cycle diagram (hatchling, juvenile, adult). 
2. Translate the verbal description into a 3x3 projection matrix. State any assumptions you make about the juvenile stasis and transition rates.
3. Use the initial population sizes given (1000 hatchlings, 150 juveniles, 5 adults) and project the population for 20 time steps.
4. Calculate the dominant eigenvalue and interpret whether the population grows or declines.
5. Compare your approach with the workflow in `2_07_matrixModels.Rmd`.

## Takeaways

- Verbal life-history descriptions can be translated directly into matrix entries with clear assumptions.
- Simple projections reveal whether the implied population is growing or declining.
