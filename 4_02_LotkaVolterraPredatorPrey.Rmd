# Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamics

In the classic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model (Rosenzweig and MacArthur 1963), the predator and prey populations grow exponentially. Modifications to the model include the availability of refuges (places where the prey are safe from predators) and carrying capacity (i.e. using logistic growth).

In this class you will follow a PDF worksheet ([here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhwoe161wp9p6hp/10.%20Predator-prey%20dynamics.pdf?dl=1)) which guides you to build and explore a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model in Excel. The model has parameters for the prey and for the predator, and you will explore how these parameters influence the dynamics of the populations.

Learning outcomes: 

- Competence in constructing an Excel-based population model.
- Understanding how the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model works, and how it is visualised.

```


The worksheet is divided into three parts. We will mainly **focus on Part 1** - the basic model - in the class. 

After completing the Excel sheet, try to answer the following questions:

1. Does a larger prey population growth rate (R) increase or decrease the stability of the predator-prey interaction?
2. What happens if the predators starve more quickly? Less quickly?
3. What happens if the predator is more efficient at converting prey into offspring? Less efficient?
4. What happens if the predator is better at finding prey? Worse?
5. Is the behavior of the model sensitive to starting populations? Begin with populations near the point where the isoclines cross, and move slowly farther out.
6. What is the ultimate outcome of the predator-prey interaction, regardless of parameter values? How does this compare to real predator and prey populations? What factors not included in the model may explain the differences between model predictions and reality?

## Optional extras

Part 2 modifies the basic model to include a refuge, and part 3 modifies the model to include carrying capacity. Feel free to continue to work on these if there is time, and if you are interested.
