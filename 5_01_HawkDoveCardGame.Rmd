# Game theory: Hawks and doves

In this activity, you will play the hawk and dove game with a single partner and then with multiple partners to observe the hypothetical costs and benefits of the antagonist or cooperative behavior, respectively.

Before the activity starts, review the cost-benefit payoff table below to understand how to score the game.

## The payoff table

The general payoff table looks like this:

|   |   |  Player 2 |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   | Hawk  | Dove  |
| **Player1**  | Hawk | (B-C)/2  | B  |
|   | Dove  | 0  | B/2  |


You can determine the benefit by looking at the left column and choosing the row corresponding to the card you played. The box that corresponds to your partner's choice is in the top row. For this game, B equals four (4), and C equals three (3). So depending on the cards played, player one (i.e., you) would gain a score of two (2), four (4), zero (0), or one-half (0.5). Like this:

|   |   |  Player 2 |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   | Hawk  | Dove  |
| **Player1**  | Hawk | 0.5  | 4  |
|   | Dove  | 0  | 2  |



## Hypotheses

The experimental hypothesis for this exercise could be that the dove strategy will become more frequent between repeated partners, and the hawk strategy will become more frequent when interacting with a variety of partners. Conversely, the null hypothesis could be that there will be no change in strategy over time with repeat or different partner combinations. 

## GAME ONE

1. Collect a set of two game cards.

2. Take out the cards labeled hawk and dove and place them face down on the table or conceal them in your hands.

3. When the instructor gives the signal, show either of the two cards to the student sitting across from you. Try to strategise how to receive the highest benefit from every interaction, but do not communicate with your partner.

4. In the Single Partner Recording Table (Table 2, [download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/48lypfd6o0hi46e/Table_2_Group_behavior.xlsx?dl=1)) provided by your instructor, note the cards played and the benefit you received for that round.

5. Repeat the interaction by showing cards to the same partner and determining the benefit,  on your instructor's signal, for a total of 15 rounds.

6. At the end of those 15 rounds, the student with the highest total benefit value is determined to be the "winner", or the most fit.

7. As a class, determine the percentages of hawks and doves played as well as the average benefit received for each round, using this formula: *Class average benefit = (sum total benefit)/(number of players)*

## GAME TWO

1. For the second game, you should find a new partner for each of the 15 rounds (if possible).

2. Continue playing for 15 rounds or until students end up back in their starting positions, recording the data in the Multiple Partner Recording Table (Table 3, [download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3tjkck3kmpek6xc/Table_3_Group_behavior.xlsx?dl=1)) given to you by your instructor.

3. For each round, determine the percentages of hawks and doves played that round and the average benefit received, again using the formula: *Class average benefit = (sum total benefit)/(number of players)*


## SUMMARISE RESULTS

For both the single partner hawk-dove game and the multiple partners hawk-dove game, use the whole class data to plot the percentages as two separate lines - one for the percentage of hawks, and one for the percentage of doves, for each of the 15 rounds.

Take note of whether the cards played changed as more rounds were played.

Consider which type of strategy would most likely evolve in a setting where partners interact repeatedly.

Then, note which tactic might be beneficial for a species that relies on cooperation.

Discuss as a class what would likely happen if you increased or decreased the relative value of the benefits you receive.


If we have time: Manipulate the values for B and C to see if you can find the point at which values of B and C would render the hawk strategy no longer effective (this would be the point when there is no benefit to choosing the hawk strategy over always choosing the dove strategy).
