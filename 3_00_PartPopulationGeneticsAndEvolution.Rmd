# Part 3: Population Genetics and Evolution {#part-3 .unnumbered}

This part introduces the genetic mechanisms that shape evolutionary change. You will connect allele frequencies to forces like selection, drift, and heritability.

By the end of Part 3, you should be able to:

- Use Hardy-Weinberg logic to interpret allele and genotype frequencies.
- Simulate allele frequency change under different evolutionary forces.
- Estimate heritability and interpret its evolutionary implications.
