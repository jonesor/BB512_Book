## Background 

Matrix population models are powerful and widely used tools in population ecology that offer a comprehensive framework for studying the dynamics of structured populations. Unlike simple growth models that assume homogeneous populations, matrix population models take into account the variation in vital rates, such as birth, death, and growth rates, across different life stages or age classes. These models are particularly well-suited for species with distinct life stages, such as plants with seedlings, juveniles, and adults, or animals with different age classes. Matrix population models use transition matrices to represent the relationships between different age classes and how individuals move from one stage to another over time. By incorporating demographic data and life-history traits, matrix population models provide a more realistic and detailed understanding of population dynamics, making them invaluable for predicting the future trends of populations and assessing their vulnerability to environmental changes and management actions.

This practical aims to give you a good understanding of the basics of their construction and use.

## Worked example

Using the example 3-stage matrix shown, the projection produces exponential growth with a dominant eigenvalue $\lambda > 1$. The corresponding stable stage distribution shows the long-term proportions of each stage.


## Your task

1) First, think of an organism you would like to model the dynamics of. It could be a mammal, a bird, a fish, insect or tree ... real or fantasy.  

2) Think about their life cycle, and draw it as a life cycle diagram with circles indicating the stages and arrows representing transitions between stages (e.g. growth) and reproduction. Keep it simple if you can (max. 3 stages).

Things to think about:

* Is it age based or stage based?
* How many stages are there? Can you simplify (e.g. instead of age in years, you could use life stage)
* If using stages, how are stages defined? E.g. by size, by development, etc.
* Are the survival and fecundity higher in earlier or later life?
* Does the organism ever skip stages?
* Can the organism move "backwards" through the life cycle?

3) Next to the arrows, write values for survival probability and fecundity (number of babies) using your biological knowledge. It is fine to use "ballpark" estimates.



Here's an example for a fictional organism.

```{r setup, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
matA_elas <- matrix(c(4, 4))

while (length(which(matA_elas == max(matA_elas))) != 1) {
  matA <- matrix(c(
    sample(seq(0.05, .3, .05), 1), sample(seq(8, 10, .5), 1), 
    sample(seq(0, 4, .5), 1),
    sample(seq(0, .7, .05), 1), sample(seq(0, .7, .05), 1), 0.0,
    0.0, sample(seq(0, .7, .05), 1), sample(seq(0, .9, .05), 1)
  ), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
  matA <- round(matA, 2)
  (matA_elas <- round(popdemo::elas(matA), 2))
}

matA
```


```{r showmatrix, echo = TRUE}
matA <- matrix(c(
  0.3, 8.00, 2.00,
  0.1, 0.50, 0.00,
  0.0, 0.40, 0.40
), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
matA <- round(matA, 2)
```
```{r plotmatrix, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "."}
matA_plot <- Rage::plot_life_cycle(matA, stages = c("A", "B", "C"))

# 1. Make a play graph
tmp <- matA_plot

# 2. Convert to SVG, then save as png
tmp <- DiagrammeRsvg::export_svg(tmp)
tmp <- charToRaw(tmp) # flatten
rsvg::rsvg_png(tmp, "tempLifeCycleDiagram.png") # saved graph as png in current working directory
```

![ ](tempLifeCycleDiagram.png)


4) Now you can turn this diagram into a matrix population model by filling in a square of survival/fecundity values. 

The life cycle shown above looks like this:

```{r showmatrix2, echo = FALSE}
# Function to write matrix as LaTeX
write_matex2 <- function(x) {
  begin <- "\\begin{bmatrix}"
  end <- "\\end{bmatrix}"
  X <-
    apply(x, 1, function(x) {
      paste(
        paste(x, collapse = "&"),
        "\\\\"
      )
    })
  paste(c(begin, X, end), collapse = "")
}
```
$$
A = `r write_matex2(matA)`
$$

## Using R for matrix modelling

Working with matrices is very tedious in Excel. However, in R you can use this information to predict the future dynamics of the population, and estimate population growth rate, and generation time etc.

Open up **RStudio**, and let's see if we can predict future dynamics. First you will need to install a package called `popdemo`.

```{r install, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("popdemo")
```
 
You only need to install packages once. After that you can load the package for use by using the `library` function.

```{r library, message = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(popdemo)
```

You can put your matrix into R like in the example below (change the numbers to match YOUR model). If your model has fewer, or more, stages then you will need to modify the code a bit. Ask for help if you get stuck.


```{r createMatrix, echo = TRUE}
A <- matrix(c(
  0.3, 8.00, 2.00,
  0.1, 0.50, 0.00,
  0.0, 0.40, 0.40
), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
```

## Projecting the population

And now you can use the project function to project what happens to the population, then plot it. Look at what happens if you log or don’t log the y-axis. First you need to define an initial starting population structure. 

In my example, I have 3 stages, so I have 3 values for the initial population sizes. Then I use the `popdemo` function `project` to do a population projection for 10 time steps.

```{r projectpopulation, echo = TRUE}
initial <- c(10, 5, 3)
pr <- popdemo::project(A, vector = initial, time = 10)
```

Take a look at `pr`, the projected population. This gives you the total population size, and below that the population sizes in each stage. 

```{r showprojection, echo = TRUE}
pr
```

You can access the population sizes of the different stages using `vec(pr)`.

```{r showprojection2, echo = TRUE}
vec(pr)
```

Let's plot this... 

```{r plotprojectiongraph, echo = TRUE}
pop <- vec(pr)
matplot(pop, type = "l", log = "y")
legend("topleft", legend = colnames(pop), 
       col = 1:ncol(pop), lty = 1:ncol(pop))
```

You should see that the population increases exponentially. The population growth rate is the so-called "*dominant eigenvalue*" of the matrix **A**.

We can ask R for the  *eigen values* and *eigen vectors*. These are the population growth rate ($\lambda$) and the stable stage distribution (*SSD*) and the reproductive values (*RV*) of the different stages. *SSD* is the expected *proportion* of individuals in the different stage classes at equilibrium (i.e. the long-term time frame) and *RV* is the expected number of future offspring by individuals in each stage.

You can see that in this case, using my example values the population is growing `r format(100*(eigs(A)$lambda-1),2,4)`% per year.

```{r eigenproperties, echo = TRUE}
eigs(A)
```

## Elasticity

Elasticity analysis is a way of analysing a matrix model to identify the most important transitions to population growth. This is very important in management and conservation when we ask questions like, "which parts of the lifecycle should we focus on to preserve the population?". The mathematics of this are beyond this course, but in a nutshell, we are adding a small value to the elements of the matrix one-at-a-time and asking what difference this makes to population growth rate (lambda). We then express that as a *proportion*, so that the elasticities sum up to one and are easier to interpret. They can be calculated easily in R.

```{r elasticity, echo = TRUE}
popdemo::elas(A)
```

What transition is most important to population growth, according to the above?


## Life table response experiment (LTRE)

These don't have much to do with life tables (sorry, that's confusing!). The idea is very simple: you run "experiments" on your matrix model by asking "what if" questions. For example, what would happen if we could increase survival of the juveniles by 20%? what would happen if adults are hunted more, and thus have a decreased survival by 60%? what would happen if we provided supplemental food to reproducing females, and increase fecundity by 50%? etc. Use your imagination!

In practice, we do that simply by modifying the matrix model. In the following, I am looking at the effect of increasing fertility in adult and senescent individuals by 50%:

```{r ltre, echo = TRUE}
A <- matrix(c(
  0.3, 8.00*1.5, 2.00*1.5,
  0.1, 0.50, 0.00,
  0.0, 0.40, 0.40
),
byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3
)

popdemo::eigs(A, what = "lambda")
elas(A)
```


## Your turn...

Work through the above process for your own species. 

(1) Do a projection, 
(2) calculate (and interpret) lambda and elasticity, 
(3) do an LTRE

### An evolutionary experiment

You can think of lambda (population growth rate) as being a measure of fitness. Imagine that some of your population had a mutation that caused them to have, say, 1 extra baby, but at the expense of reduced survival in one of the younger stages. Would this mutation persist in the population? Do an LTRE to find out!


### Questions

1. In the graph showing log-transformed population size through time, what is the significance of the lines being straight after the transient phase?

<!-- When the population size is plotted on a logarithmic scale against time, and the lines become straight after the transient phase, it signifies exponential growth or decline in the population. A straight line on a log-transformed graph implies that the population is growing (or shrinking) at a constant rate, meaning the population growth rate has stabilized. --->

2. Explain how an elasticity analysis of a matrix model can be used to inform the management of a threatened species.

<!-- 
Elasticity analysis measures the proportional sensitivity of the population growth rate to small changes in vital rates such as survival, growth, and reproduction. It identifies which transitions (demographic rates) have the greatest impact on the population's growth rate.

For the management of a threatened species, elasticity analysis can reveal the most critical life stages or vital rates to target for conservation efforts. For example:

If elasticity analysis shows that adult survival has the largest impact on population growth, conservation measures might focus on protecting adult individuals (e.g., through habitat protection or reducing human-induced mortality).
If juvenile survival has a high elasticity, efforts may be directed at improving the survival of juveniles, perhaps through habitat restoration or predator control.

By identifying the most influential life stages, managers can allocate resources more effectively, focusing on interventions that will have the greatest positive impact on population recovery.
-->

3. What are some of the assumptions of a matrix population model? (Hint: some are similar to the assumptions of exponential/geometric growth models)

<!-- 
Matrix population models share some assumptions with simpler models like exponential or geometric growth models. Key assumptions include:

- Constant vital rates: The model assumes that survival, fecundity, and growth rates are constant over time. This is similar to the assumption of a constant growth rate in exponential models.
- Stable environment: The model assumes the environment does not change over time, affecting demographic rates in a predictable, constant way.
- Closed population: Like exponential and geometric models, matrix models often assume no immigration or emigration, meaning population changes are solely due to births and deaths.
No density dependence: Matrix models generally assume that vital rates are not affected by population size. This is akin to the assumption in exponential models where growth occurs without limits.

-->

## Takeaways

- Matrix models link life history to population growth through structured vital rates.
- The dominant eigenvalue $\lambda$ summarizes long-term growth, while eigenvectors capture stable structure and reproductive value.
- Elasticity and LTREs turn models into management and evolutionary experiments.
