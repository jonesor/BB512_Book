# Basic logistic population growth

## Background

In nature, populations can’t grow indefinitely. They eventually reach an upper limit, known as the *carrying capacity* ($K$), which represents the maximum number of individuals an environment can support. Factors like available resources, competition, predation, and disease set this limit.

The **logistic growth model** accounts for this limitation and provides a more realistic picture of population growth. Unlike simpler models, such as exponential growth, that assume unlimited resources, the logistic model reflects how populations slow their growth as they approach the carrying capacity. When the population is small, it can grow quickly, but as it gets closer to the limit, the growth rate slows down. When the population is at carrying capacity the population will not grow (birth rates = death rates).

The model is described by the following equation:

$N_{t+1} = N_{t} + r_{m} N_{t} \left(1 - \frac{N_{t}}{K}\right)$

Where:

- $N_{t+1}$ is the population size at the next time step.
- $N_t$ is the current population size.
- $r_m$ is the intrinsic growth rate, or the maximum possible per capita population growth rate.
- $K$ is the carrying capacity.

In this equation, the term $\left(1 - \frac{N_t}{K}\right)$ slows population growth as the population size $N_t$ approaches $K$. If $N_t = K$, the population stops growing.

As growth rates increase beyond a certain point, the population can exhibit more complex behaviours. At higher growth rates, populations may overshoot the carrying capacity, leading to oscillations as they fluctuate around it. In some cases, the population may show what’s called deterministic chaos. This means that while the population fluctuates unpredictably, the system itself is not random — small changes in initial conditions or growth rates can lead to vastly different outcomes.

This Excel-based exercise will help you explore how changes in the growth rate and carrying capacity affect population dynamics. Though simple, the logistic model provides valuable insights into how populations stabilize, fluctuate, and respond to environmental limits.

## Worked example

With `Initial N = 10`, `r_m = 0.8`, and `K = 200`, the population grows quickly at first, then slows as it approaches `K`. This produces a sigmoidal curve and a per-capita growth rate that declines linearly with `N`.

## Your Task

In this exercise, you will explore how changes in key parameters affect population dynamics using the logistic growth model. Follow the steps below to guide your analysis.

1. **Download the Excel File**  
   Download and open the Excel file: [`Basic Logistic Growth.xlsx`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oxxyyn4zf4wsvkg/Basic%20Logistic%20Growth.xlsx?dl=1).

2. **Familiarise Yourself with the Spreadsheet**  
   In the file, you’ll see three sections:
   - **Pink Block**: This is where you will input and adjust the model parameters.
   - **Graphs**: These display how the population behaves over time and in relation to the parameters you adjust.

3. **Understand the Parameters**  
   In the *pink block*, you will find the key parameters of the logistic growth model:
   - `Initial N`: The starting population size at time 1 (default = 10).
   - `r_m`: The maximum per capita population growth rate (default = 0.8). 
     - If $r_m > 0$, the population grows.
     - If $r_m < 0$, the population shrinks.
     - The population size cannot fall below zero.
   - `K`: The carrying capacity of the population (default = 200).

4. **Explore the Model**  
   Use the following steps to guide your exploration of population dynamics:

### Graph 1: Population Size Through Time

- **Step 1**: Examine the default settings in Graph 1, where `Initial N` = 10, `r_m` = 0.8, and `K` = 200.  

  - What is the maximum population size in relation to the carrying capacity?  
    
    <!-- For low values of $r_m$ The maximum population size should be equal to the carrying capacity, so around 200. -->
    
  - At what time does the population reach its maximum size?  
    
    <!-- The population reaches its maximum size relatively quickly, around 17 time steps. -->

- **Step 2**: Increase the carrying capacity (`K`) to 300.  
  **Prediction**: What do you expect to happen to the population size over time?  
  
  <!-- The maximum population size should increase to around 300. -->

  **Test**: How does increasing `K` affect the maximum population size and the time taken to reach it?  

  <!-- Increasing `K` results in a higher maximum population size, but the time to reach it remains roughly the same. -->

- **Step 3**: Halve the growth rate (`r_m`) to 0.4.  
  **Prediction**: How will this change affect the population’s growth and the time it takes to reach the maximum population size?  
  <!-- The population will grow more slowly, so it will take longer to reach the carrying capacity. -->
  
  **Test**: What do you observe in the graph?  
  
  <!-- The population takes about twice as long to reach the carrying capacity (roughly 40 time steps). -->

- **Step 4**: Increase `r_m` to 1.8.  

  - How does the population size change over time?
  
    <!-- The population overshoots the carrying capacity, reaching a size larger than `K`, then starts fluctuating around `K`. -->
  - How does the maximum population size compare to the carrying capacity?  
    
    <!-- The population temporarily exceeds the carrying capacity, showing oscillations above and below `K`. A common misconception is that `K` is the maximum population size, but this is not true.-->
  - How would you describe the dynamics of this population (e.g., overshoot, oscillations)?  
    
    <!-- The dynamics show damped oscillations, where the population overshoots and then oscillates before eventually settling close to `K`. -->

- **Step 5**: Experiment with higher values for `r_m` (e.g., 2.0, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0).  

  - How do the population dynamics change as `r_m` increases?  
    
    <!-- As `r_m` increases, the oscillations become larger and more pronounced, leading to chaotic behaviour at higher values. -->
  - What happens when `r_m` is 2.8 or 3.0^[The behaviour where `r_m` values above 3 cause the population to become very negative, is a mathematical artefact caused by numerical instability in the discrete-time logistic growth model. When the growth rate is too high, the population can overshoot its carrying capacity, and the formula's negative feedback term can drive the population to unrealistic, negative values. This issue arises because the model doesn't impose biological constraints, such as preventing population sizes from falling below zero. In real biological systems, such negative values would not occur.]? Are the dynamics predictable or chaotic?  
    
    <!-- For `r_m` around 2.8, the population enters chaotic oscillations. The population fluctuates unpredictably around `K` with no clear pattern. -->


- **Step 6**: Compare the population trajectory for populations with `r_m` = 2.8 and `r_m` = 2.81, and then fix `r_m` at 2.8 but vary the initial population size by a small amount.  

  - How sensitive are these populations to small changes in `r_m` or the initial population size?
  
    <!-- Very sensitive. Small changes in `r_m` or the initial population size result in dramatically different trajectories due to the chaotic nature of the system at high `r_m`. -->
  - Would these populations be easy or hard to predict?  
   
    <!-- They would be very difficult to predict because of the chaotic dynamics. Even tiny changes lead to unpredictable outcomes. -->
  - What kinds of species have high population growth rates like this? How might this relate to managing pest species or diseases?  
 
    <!-- Species with high growth rates, like locusts or certain pathogens, can display chaotic or rapid fluctuations, making them difficult to manage. This unpredictability is a challenge for population managers or those controlling pests and diseases. -->


### Graph 2: Per Capita Growth Rate vs. Population Size

- **Step 1**: Examine Graph 2 with the default settings (`Initial N` = 10, `r_m` = 0.8, `K` = 200).
  - How does the per capita growth rate change as the population size increases?  
  
    <!-- The per capita growth rate decreases linearly as the population size increases. -->
  - Where does the per capita growth rate cross the x-axis (population size)?  
  
    <!-- The per capita growth rate crosses the x-axis when the population size reaches the carrying capacity (`K`), which in this case is 200. -->

- **Step 2**: Modify the carrying capacity (`K`) to 300 and observe the changes in Graph 2.
  - How does increasing the carrying capacity affect where the per capita growth rate crosses the x-axis?  
  
    <!-- Increasing the carrying capacity shifts the point where the per capita growth rate crosses the x-axis to 300. -->
  - Does the slope of the per capita growth rate change when you alter `K`?  
  
    <!-- No, the slope remains the same, but the intercept on the x-axis moves to the new carrying capacity. -->

- **Step 3**: Change `r_m` to 1.8 and observe how the graph is affected.
  - How does increasing `r_m` affect the shape of the curve?
  
    <!-- The slope of the line becomes steeper, indicating that the per capita growth rate decreases more rapidly as the population increases. -->
  - Does the intercept on the x-axis change when you increase `r_m`?  
  
    <!-- No, the intercept on the x-axis (carrying capacity) remains at `K`, which is still 200, but the y-intercept increases due to the higher growth rate. -->

- **Step 4**: Experiment with different values for `K` and `r_m`.  
  - How do changes in `K` and `r_m` together affect the graph?  

    <!-- Increasing `K` shifts the x-axis intercept further to the right, while increasing `r_m` makes the slope steeper and increases the y-intercept. -->

### Reflection on Graph 2

- **Step 5**: Compare the per capita growth rate in **Graph 2** to the population size over time in **Graph 1**.
  **Questions**:  
  - How are the two graphs connected?  

## Takeaways

- Logistic growth captures density dependence through the carrying capacity $K$.
- High growth rates can cause overshoot, oscillations, or chaos in discrete-time models.
- Per-capita growth declines linearly with population size in the logistic model.
    
    <!-- The decline in the per capita growth rate in Graph 2 reflects the slowing population growth shown in Graph 1. As the population size approaches `K` in Graph 1, the per capita growth rate approaches zero in Graph 2. -->
  - What would the per capita growth rate look like for a population experiencing exponential growth instead of logistic growth?  
    
    <!-- In exponential growth, the per capita growth rate would remain constant, so the line would be horizontal, not declining with population size. -->

These steps help you visualise how population size and per capita growth rate are interrelated, reinforcing the concepts behind logistic population growth.

## Questions

* In the logistic growth model, what happens to the population growth rate as the population size approaches the carrying capacity ($K$)? How does this lead to population stability?
    
    <!-- As the population approaches $K$, the growth rate decreases due to the term $\left(1 - \frac{N_t}{K}\right)$ in the model. This slowing of growth continues until the growth rate reaches zero at $K$. The rate at which the population approaches $K$ depends on the intrinsic growth rate ($r_m$). Higher $r_m$ values result in faster growth and potentially more oscillations or overshoots around $K$, while lower $r_m$ values lead to a smoother approach to stability. -->


* In the logistic growth model, what factors can cause a population to overshoot its carrying capacity temporarily? How does the population respond to such overshooting?
    
    <!-- Factors such as a high intrinsic growth rate ($r_m$) or a delay in density-dependent effects can cause overshooting. After overshooting, the population may oscillate around the carrying capacity before stabilizing, or in extreme cases, exhibit chaotic behaviour. -->

* How can a ballpark knowledge of maximum per capita population growth rate ($r_m$) be useful to a population manager?
    
    <!-- Knowing $r_m$ helps a manager anticipate the growth rate of the population under optimal conditions, which informs decisions about the timing of interventions (e.g., pest control, species reintroduction). It also helps predict whether the population will exhibit stable dynamics, oscillations, or chaotic behaviour, which is critical for planning and managing populations effectively. -->

* What are the key assumptions of the logistic growth model, and how might these assumptions limit its real-world application?
    
    <!-- The logistic model assumes that the carrying capacity ($K$) is constant, resources are evenly distributed, and environmental conditions do not change. In reality, carrying capacity can fluctuate due to factors like climate change, resource availability, or human impact, which may limit the model’s predictive accuracy in dynamic ecosystems. -->

## Optional: Do this in R.

You can implement this model in R as follows.
In this code, I have added a line which ensures that population size cannot be negative.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Parameters
r_m <- 3.5  # intrinsic growth rate
K <- 1000   # carrying capacity
N0 <- 10    # initial population size
timesteps <- 50  # number of time steps

# Initialize population vector
population <- numeric(timesteps)
population[1] <- N0

# Initialize per capita growth rate vector
# Length of one less than population, as it's based on changes
per_capita_growth <- numeric(timesteps - 1)  

# Loop to calculate population at each time step
for (t in 2:timesteps) {
  # Logistic growth model equation
  population[t] <- population[t-1] + 
    (r_m * population[t-1]) * (1 - (population[t-1] / K))
  
  # Ensure population doesn't go negative
  if (population[t] < 0) {
    population[t] <- 0
  }
  
  # Calculate per capita growth rate for the previous time step
  per_capita_growth[t-1] <- (population[t] - 
                               population[t-1]) / population[t-1]
}

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# Plot 1: Population size through time
plot(1:timesteps, population, type = "o", col = "blue", 
     xlab = "Time", ylab = "Population size",
     main = "Population Size through Time (Logistic Growth Model)")

# Plot 2: Per capita growth rate vs population size
plot(population[1:(timesteps-1)], per_capita_growth, 
     type = "o", col = "red", 
     xlab = "Population Size", 
     ylab = "Per Capita Growth Rate",
     main = "Per Capita Growth Rate vs Population Size")

```
